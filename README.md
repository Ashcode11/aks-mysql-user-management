# User Management Application with MySQL on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for a user management application built with MySQL database hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The application provides functionalities to manage user data, including registration, authentication, and profile management.

The application is designed to run on Kubernetes using Azure Disk persistent storage for data persistence. It leverages AKS for container orchestration and Azure Disk for storing MySQL data.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- User profile management (update profile, change password, etc.)
- MySQL database for data storage
- Kubernetes deployment using Helm charts
- Azure Disk persistent storage for MySQL data

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Azure account with access to AKS and Azure Disk
- Azure CLI installed locally for managing Azure resources
- kubectl CLI installed locally for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
- Helm CLI installed locally for managing Helm charts
- Docker installed locally for building container images

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy the user management application on AKS:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `deployments` directory:

    ```bash
    cd deployments
    ```

3. Edit the `values.yaml` file in the `charts/user-management` directory to configure the application settings and MySQL connection details.

4. Deploy the application to AKS using Helm:

    ```bash
    helm install user-management ./charts/user-management
    ```

5. Monitor the deployment and check the status of the pods:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

6. Access the application by navigating to the public IP address of the AKS cluster.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the `values.yaml` file in the `charts/user-management` directory. The following configuration options are available:

- `mysql.host`: Hostname of the MySQL database server
- `mysql.port`: Port number of the MySQL database server
- `mysql.database`: Name of the MySQL database
- `mysql.username`: Username for connecting to the MySQL database
- `mysql.password`: Password for connecting to the MySQL database
- `azureDisk.storageClassName`: Storage class name for Azure Disk
- `azureDisk.diskSize`: Size of the Azure Disk for MySQL data
